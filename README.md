# 🌟 Koru's Mod [WIP]

---

This is my first mod — I'm just adding whatever feels fun and cool!  
It's built using [Kaupenjoe's](https://www.youtube.com/@ModdingByKaupenjoe) Fabric modding tutorial for Minecraft **1.21.x**.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Make sure you have the **latest JDK** installed.
2. Open the mod folder with your code editor (I'm using **IntelliJ IDEA** 💻).
3. Done! You can now run the **Minecraft Client** and play with the mod. 🎮
